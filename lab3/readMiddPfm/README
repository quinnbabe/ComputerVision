# Install
type "mex mexMiddPfmRead.c" in matlab console


# Usage:
This pfm reader is only for middlebury 2014 stereo database.
So only one channel is supported, and it assumes a big
endian machine, which should cover normal PC, OSX, Linux, ect..

type "d = readMiddPfm('disp0.pfm');" to read a 'disp0.pfm' file.

Note that the data is sub-pixel accurate, meaning the data is 
not integer. You can use 'round' to convert it to 'integers'.
